# StereoCalibration-Rectification
Recording the learning process of computer vision

A student from SCU.

Since task 14 needs the results of task 12, so I combined them both in one archive.

The archive named "StereoCalibration-Rectification" contains the images, programs and results of task 12, 14. The folder called "Stereo Calibration" solves task 12 and the folder called "Rectification" solves task 14.

Step 1.

Download the archive and extract it to a specified folder. The path of initial pictures is ../StereoCalibration-Rectification/Project_Stereo_left and ../StereoCalibration-Rectification/Project_Stereo_right.

Step 2.

This task is completed under MAC OS, so just opening the project through Xcode.(Please configure OpenCV with Xcode first.)

If you are using windows operating system, please see README.md in "Learning-Opencv".

Step 3.

Change the file path to your own path, including the path of initial pictures and the path of results. Please note: the format of the file path is different between Windows and MAC.

If you are using windows operating system, please see README.md in "Learning-Opencv".

Step 4.

Open "Stereo Calibration" through Xcode and Run!

Step 5.

Open "Rectification" through Xcode and Run!

Step 6.

Check the results of data.

The file path of calibration_result_left.txt, calibration_result_right.txt and stereo_result.txt is ../StereoCalibrate-Rectification/⁨Stereo Calibration/Stereo Calibration⁩/Build⁩/Products⁩/⁨Debug.⁩ 

The file path of rectify_result.txt is ../StereoCalibrate-Rectification/⁨Stereo Calibration/Stereo Calibration⁩/Build⁩/Products⁩/⁨Debug.⁩ 

Step 7.

Check the result of pictures in folders "stereoCalibrate" and "Rectification_result".
